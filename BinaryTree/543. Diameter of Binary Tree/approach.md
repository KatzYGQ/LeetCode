# Diameter of Binary Tree - Solution Explanation

This document explains the implementation of a class `Solution` designed to calculate the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Class: Solution

The class `Solution` contains two methods: `diameterOfBinaryTree` and `height`.

### Method: `diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root)`

#### Purpose

Calculates the diameter of a binary tree.

#### Parameters

- `root`: The root node of the binary tree.

#### Implementation

- **Base Case**: If `root` is null, returns 0. An empty tree has no diameter.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - Calculates the diameter of the left and right subtrees (`left` and `right`) by recursively calling `diameterOfBinaryTree`.
  - Computes the height of the left and right subtrees of the current node by calling the `height` method.
  - The diameter through the current node is the sum of the heights of these subtrees plus 2 (to account for the edges connecting the node).
  - Returns the maximum of three values:
    - Diameter through the current node.
    - Diameter of the left subtree.
    - Diameter of the right subtree.

This ensures the largest diameter found in any part of the tree is returned.

### Method: `height(TreeNode root)`

#### Purpose

Calculates the height of a binary tree.

#### Parameters

- `root`: The root node of the binary tree.

#### Implementation

- **Base Case**: If `root` is null, returns -1. The height of an empty tree is -1.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - Calculates the height of the left and right subtrees by recursively calling `height`.
  - Returns the maximum of the heights of these subtrees plus 1 (to account for the edge connecting the node).

## Overall Functionality

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method determines the diameter of the tree by considering the longest path through the root and the longest paths within the left and right subtrees. It uses the `height` method to calculate the height of subtrees, which is essential in determining the path length. The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree, and this implementation effectively finds that by considering all possible paths.
